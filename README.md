# Litecoin Developer Guide
Find detailed information about the Litecoin protocol and related specifications.

The Litecoin Developer Guide aims to provide the information you need to understand Litecoin and start building Litecoin-based applications, but it is not a specification. To make the best use of this documentation, you may want to install the current version of Litecoin Core, either from source or from a pre-compiled executable.

Questions about Litecoin development are best asked in one of the Litecoin development communities. Errors or suggestions related to documentation can be submitted as an issue `or posted to the litecoin-documentation mailing list`.

In the following documentation, some strings have been shortened or wrapped: “[…]” indicates extra data was removed, and lines ending in a single backslash “\” are continued below. If you hover your mouse over a paragraph, cross-reference links will be shown in blue. If you hover over a cross-reference link, a brief definition of the term will be displayed in a tooltip.
